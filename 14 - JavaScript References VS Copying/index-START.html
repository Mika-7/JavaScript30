    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // Just Copy Value,Not pointer address
    let age1 = 100;
    let age2 = age1;
    console.log(age1,age2);
    age1 = 200;
    console.log(age1,age2);

    let name1 = 'mika';
    let name2 = name1;
    console.log(name1,name2);
    name1 = 'aki';
    console.log(name1,name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // Reference
    const team = players;

    console.log(players,team);

    team[3] = 'xiaoming';
    // 同时改变，使用的是指针的引用
    console.log(players,team);


    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.age = 99;

    console.log(`person.age:${person.age}`);

    // Copy 
    // 只复制一层深度的内容
    const cap2 = Object.assign({},person,{name:'Mika',age:16});

    console.log(person,cap2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const cap3 = {...person};

    console.log(cap3);
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twiiter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.devloper'
      }
    };

    console.log(wes);
    // 只 clone 一层
    const dev = Object.assign({},wes);
    // 通过转换成字符串后再转成对象 全部都 clone
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
